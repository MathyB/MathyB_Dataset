# Mathematical Expressions in Software Engineering Artifacts
## MathyB dataset
To run MEDSEA: A Mathematical Expression Detector Tool for Software Engineering Artifacts, download the dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/3965149#.YSDic44zZPY. Change the <b>INPUT_PATH</b> to the location of the project in your local system and <b>OUTPUT_PATH</b> to the location in your local system where you want to save the output.
Then execute '''python
python MEFinder.py
'''

The web version of our tool is available at the <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/mathyb/mathyb_dataset/main/MEFinder.py">project site</a>
## NNGen
 We provide ME removed data for NNGen in this repo. Kindly refer to this Gihub repo https://github.com/Tbabm/nngen for commands on running the NNGen project.
